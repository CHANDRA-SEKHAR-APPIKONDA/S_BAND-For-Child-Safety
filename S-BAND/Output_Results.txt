Here we presenting maximum fluctuations occured because of obstacles by wall etc...

=================================================================================================

Note : Here we provided maximum fluctuated values and we shortout some of the sampled values .
       We checked sampled values (INDOOR and OUTDOOR).



THANKYOU...
